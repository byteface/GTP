knowledge maps for runtime queries.

it would be nice to bulid lots of knowledge maps for runtime queries and have set of them readily available.

speifically query maps, but also those maps able to update at runtime. maybe a large set of updating maps as well as the static ones.

also common responses on those maps.

potential for storing maps results on vectors meaning mutliple operations can run simultaneously. I need to know more about how they work as im making a few assumption but do all vector update at same time on gcard?.. is it parrallel processed.


another part to that is finding the variables in common responses that can be replaced in output.

i.e.

common response to question "have you got the time"

a "have" map would by generated with ownership of the thinker ("you") in our case the program. once the question was comprehended then a list of responses may be available with time already on them. so the program needs to know to replace that time with the current time. It knows this due to having datatype of time in place on a word map.

how big would a full word map be?

how fast could the gpu get information out of a word map.
