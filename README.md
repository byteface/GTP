GTP - Graphic Transfer Protocol


So I was investigating NLP and thought it would be fun if you could do that on the front end. Whilst trying to do sentiment analysis on the front end I wrapped some data up into pixels and it proved a good way to optimize data. This unwraps easily by using canvas to get the data back out of the pixels and you can see that working in the GTP folder.

you will see I load an image, and get the data of it and write it straight to the page. You can see that working here...

furthermore in the play folder I simplified and removed the sentiment analysis stuff to do text searching on the GPU. It's quite cool and very fast but far from finished.

at this locationâ€¦

you can type 3 characters and it will find them in the document. INSTANTLY. not only that im drawing it 25x a second




if you want to get involved.. please do. pull the lib, mess around suggest direction.


at moment considering a bunch of things from object manipulation to fast string search/splitting to front end based DB's
