So I was investigating NLP and thought it would be fun if you could do that on the front end. Whilst trying to do sentiment analysis on the front end I wrapped some data up into pixels and it proved a good way to optimize data. This unwraps easily by using canvas to get the data back out of the pixels and you can see that working in the GTP folder.\
\
you will see I load an image, and get the data of it and write it straight to the page. You can see that working here...\

furthermore in the play folder I simplified and removed the sentiment analysis stuff to do text searching on the GPU. It's quite cool and very fast but far from finished.\

\
you can type 3 characters and it will find them in the document. INSTANTLY. not only that im drawing it 25x a second\
\
\
\
\
if you want to get involved.. please do. pull the lib, mess around suggest direction.\
\
\
at moment considering a bunch of things from object manipulation to fast string search/splitting to front end based DB's}
